Thredded
====================

Thredded is an open source messageboard / forum that was born years ago as a small php script that's grown to something a little more involved. 

This is it's 3rd Rails-based incarnation, with hopes that all the bad cruft can be left out and something more enjoyable and open will rise from old and "less good" code.

--------------------

Requirements:

- mongodb installed and running
- ensure that config/thredded_config.yml exists with site and application specific settings (config/thredded_config_sample.yml may be copied or moved into the proper location)

--------------------

Running Autotest:

- bundle install will get all the required gems installed
- make sure to add the following line to your ~/.autotest file:

  require 'autotest/growl'

- cd APP_ROOT
- guard start &
