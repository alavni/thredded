Thredded
====================

Why?
--------------------

Two reasons. The vast majority of messageboard, or "forum", software out there is garbage.  And I can't find any current and maintained projects running on Rails (specifically version 3).

History
--------------------

This project started years ago as a side project to keep busy while the first big dot-com stuff hit the fan and things on my plate at work got real lean. Back then this was built on PHP with Mysql - like many things. The users knew what they wanted and I wanted to be able to add features without digging through someone else's cess-pool of mangled code.  I wanted my *own* cess-pool of mangled code. 

Eventually I discovered RoR and re-developed everything with Rails.  That version was terrible.  

The second version?  Also terrible.  

So, that's right - this is it's 3rd Rails-based incarnation. This time with a full(-ish) test suite.


An Admission
--------------------

The Thredded code-base is by no means a pinnacle in software engineering.  I won't be winning any code-quality competitions anytime soon. However, I'm trying my damndest to iterate and improve everything in here constantly. The important thing right now is that this works well for its users and is fun to use.  What's under the hood _will_ get better. For those familiar with the theory of the human "lizard brain" you might notice this admission as my method to push aside the nagging voice and just put this out for people to use. 

Poke around the source and take a look. If there's anything that's been overlooked or approached with an ignorant eye, let me know and send me an email.  Or, even better (of course), fork, commit and send a pull request.  I'm open to any and all thoughts.



Requirements:
--------------------

- mongodb installed and running
- ImageMagick is installed
- ensure that config/mongoid.yml exists. Usually for development environment the default that comes with this app should work.  If not, check connection information.
- ensure that config/thredded_config.yml exists with site and application specific settings (config/thredded_config_sample.yml may be copied or moved into the proper location)

--------------------
Security per messageboard - private, public or logged in users only
Permissions to post - anonymous, members or logged in users only

-Placement of attached images to posts-
-Logging in via twitter, github, facebook, linked in, and Gmail-
-Search-
-Import and Export-


Testing / Autotest:
--------------------

- bundle install will get all the required gems installed
- make sure you have `growlnotify` installed (can be found in Extras folder of the Growl dmg - http://growl.info/index.php)
- are you sure config/thredded_config.yml exists?  What about mongoid.yml? Promise?
- make sure to add the following line to your ~/.autotest file:

  require 'autotest/growl'

- cd APP_ROOT
- guard start &

for just RSpec coverage from autotest

  autotest 

for both RSpec and Cucumber

  AUTOFEATURE=true autotest
